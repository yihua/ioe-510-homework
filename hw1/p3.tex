\section{Exercise 1.3 Convert to $\leq$ form}
\textbf{Problem:} Describe a general recipe for transforming an arbitrary linear-optimization problem into one in which all of the linear constraints are of $\leq$ type.

\textbf{Solution:}

First follow the transformation to transform the constraints on every variable $x_j$ (we only consider the comparison to zero as comparison to other real number can be transformed to what we discussed):

\begin{enumerate}
\item if the constraint is in form $x_j \leq 0 $, then it is the $\leq$ form;
\item if the constraint is in form $x_j \geq 0 $, then let $x_j^- = - x_j$. Replace $x_j$ with $x_j^-$ in the objective and all constraints. So we get $x_j^- \leq 0$;
\item if $x_j$ is unrestricted, then replace $x_j$ with the difference of a pair of non-positive variables $x_j^+$ and $x_j^-$ in the objective and all constraints, that is $x_j^+-x_j^- = x_j$.
\end{enumerate}

After transforing the constraints on only variables, let's now consider other constrainsts:

\begin{enumerate}
\item if the constraint is in form $Ax \leq b$, then it is the $\leq$ form;
\item if the constraint is in form $Ax \geq b$, then change it to the equivalent constraint $(-A)x \leq -b$;
\item if the constraint is in form $Ax = b$, then replace this with $Ax + It \leq b $, where $t \leq \mathbf{0}$. Let $x^* = \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 x' & t' 
\end{array}
\right)'$, replace $x$ with $x^*$ in other constraints.
\end{enumerate}

Now we are done with all constraints and they are all in $\leq$ form.
