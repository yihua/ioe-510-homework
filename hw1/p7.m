% Here is how the 'linprog' function works:
%
% [v,z,exitflag] = linprog(c,A,b,Aeq,beq,lb,ub)
% minimizes c'v ,
% with constraints A v <= b, Aeq v = beq, and
% variable bounds lb <= v <=ub.
% Some parts of the model can be null: for example,
% set Aeq = [] and beq = [] if no equalities exist.
% set ub = [] if no upper bounds exist.
%
% [v,z,exitflag] = linprog(...) returns values:
% v = solution vector
% z = minimum objective value
% exitflag = describes the exit condition:
% 1 optimal solution found.
% ?2 problem is infeasible.
% ?3 problem is unbounded.
% ?5 problem and its dual are both infeasible
% Study the following part carefully. This is how we set up
% a block problem. [c ; f] stacks vertically the vectors c and f.
% [A B] concatenates A and B horizontally. zeros(m2,n2) is an
% m2?by?n2 matrix of 0's. ones(n1,1) is an n1?vector of 1's, and
% Inf is +infinity, so Inf*ones(n1,1) is a vector of length n1
% with all components equal to +infinity. In this way we have
% infinite upper bounds on some variables.
