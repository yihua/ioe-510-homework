\section{Exercise 1.7 Weak Duality for a complicated form --- with {\tt{MATLAB}}}

The { \tt{MATLAB}} code is as follows. We use {\tt{linprog}} function to solve the dual. We compare the optimal value of the original problem and its dual. Since there is computation deviation, we consider the difference less than $10^{-8}$ be negligible and the two optimal values are the same.
