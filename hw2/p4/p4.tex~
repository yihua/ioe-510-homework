\section{Exercise 2.4 Task scheduling}

The objective of the problem is to minimize the start time of task $n+1$, $t_{n+1}$. For the constraints on start time of each task, $t_1 = 0$ and $t_i \geq 0, i \in \mathbb{N}, 2 \leq i \leq n+1$. For the precedences between tasks, if task $j$ must be completed before task $i$ can be started, namely $j \in \Psi_i$, the start time of task $i$ must be larger than or equal to the start time of task $j$ plus the duration of task $j$, $d_j$, namely .
