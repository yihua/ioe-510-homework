\section{Exercise 8.4 Comparing facility-location formulations}
\textbf{Problem:} We have seen two formulations of the forcing constraints for the uncapacitated facility-location problem. We have a choice of the $mn$ constraints: $−y_{i} + x_{ij} \leq 0$, for $i=1, ..., m$ and $j=1,..., n$, or the $m$ constraints: $−ny_{i}+nx_{ij} \leq 0$, for $i=1,...,m$. Which formulation is stronger? That is, compare (both \textit{computationally} and \textit{analytically}) the strength of the two associated continuous relaxations (i.e., when we relax $y_{i}\in{}\lbrace0,1\rbrace$ to $0\leq{}y_{i}\leq1$, for $i=1,...,m$).  In Appendix A.3, there is AMPL code for trying computational experiments.

\textbf{Solution:}
