\section{Exercise 8.7 Make amends}
\textbf{Problem:} Find an \textit{interesting applied problem}, model it as a pure- or mixed-\textit{integer} linear-optimization problem, and test your model with AMPL. Credit will be given for \textit{deft} modeling, \textit{sophisticated} use of AMPL, testing on meaningfully-\textit{large} instances, and \textit{insightful} analysis. Try to play with CPLEX \textit{integer} solver options (they can be set through AMPL) to get better behavior of the solver.

\textbf{Solution:}
