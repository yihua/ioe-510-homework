\section{Exercise 5.6 Dual Ray}
\textbf{Problem:} Consider the linear-optimization problem
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: primal_p6}
  \begin{array}{lrcll}
    \min
    & \multicolumn{4}{l}{c'x} \\
    \text{s.t.}
    & Ax\geq b \\
    & x \geq 0
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

a) Suppose that (\ref{eq: primal_p6}) is infeasible. Then, by a `Theorem of the Alternative' there is a
solution to what system?

b) Suppose, further, that the dual of (\ref{eq: primal_p6}) is feasible. Take a feasible solution $\widehat{y}$ of dual and a solution $\tilde{y}$ to your system of part (a) and combine them appropriately to prove that the dual is unbounded.

\textbf{Solution:}
