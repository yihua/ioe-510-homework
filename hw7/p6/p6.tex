\section{Exercise 7.6}
\textbf{Problem:} Print is dying, right? Why should we care about the cutting-stock problem?

\textbf{Solution:} ``Cutting-stock problem '' is a general type of integer-linear optimization problem, not specific to the cutting-stock scenario. Another scenario that also applies to (CSP) is airplane cargo problem: Let $W$ is the maximum weight that one airplane can afford, $m$ is the number of different types of articles that the plane can carry, $w_i$ is the weight of each type of articles, $a_i$ is the number of one type of the article that one airplane carrys, $A_j$ is all the combination of the methods that an airplane can make, $x_j$ is the number of airplanes for the specific combination of carrying articles, $d$ is the minumum requirement of weight for all the airplanes each time. The optimization goal is that to minimize the number of airplanes used to transfer the cargo.
